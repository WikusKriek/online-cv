      details: |
        Student Hive App is a project I started by myself in 2019. I wanted to write my own application while also making something useful in my everyday life. I decided to write an application that would help me manage my university life. I decided to build a web application so that I could use it on my computer as well as my phone from anywhere with any device.  When the first version was completed it was so helpful and simple to use I decided to make the application available to everyone and host it on google cloud services.
